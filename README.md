# Compustat_Daily
This application allows you to search for the historical data of any US equity using a custom timeframe. The data is retrieved from Compustat North America using the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) API and is then presented in a custom candlestick chart with a volume underlay. The entire application is housed in a Tkinter GUI.
